Documentation for the Kryptosphere Hackathon
============================================

Welcome to the main technical documentation for the Hackathon. You will find everything you need to develop this weekend.

First of all you need to have a client to interact with the node of the network for this weekend we have prepared some pre-build :

- Windows: ee
- Mac: ee
- Linux: eee

When you have this client you can create an address by tying this command on the client :

    wallet_generate_private_key

Now you have created a wallet you can check the address, balance, etc... with this command :

    wallet_info

Now that you have an address you can create and deploy your first smart contract. 

You can follow `this guide <smart-contracts/massa-sc-by-example.html>`__ to deploy and interact with a tic-tac-toe.
