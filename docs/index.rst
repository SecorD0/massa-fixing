Massa: The Decentralized and Scaled Blockchain
==============================================

Massa is a truly decentralized blockchain controlled by thousands of
people. With the breakthrough multithreaded technology, we're set for
mass adoption.

Introduction
------------

`Massa <https://massa.net>`_ is a new blockchain reaching a high
transaction throughput in a decentralized network. Our research is
published in this `technical paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09029>`_.
It shows that throughput of 10'000 transactions per second is reached
even in a fully decentralized network with thousands of nodes.

An easy-to-read blog post introduction with videos is written
`here <https://massa.net/blog/post/0/>`_.

Testnet
-------

As decentralization is our core value, we would like to help you start
and run a Massa node on our testnet. You'll find a full tutorial on how
to install and stake with your node on our testnet :ref:`here <testnet-install>`.

Smart-contracts
---------------
If you are interested in building on Massa, you'll find documentation on our
smart-contract engine :ref:`here <sc-introduction>`.
