# Concurrency

The Massa system is built mostly around message-passing. This involves bi-directional communication between components on bounded channels, which comes with a risk of deadlock. To manage this risk, a distinction is made between two types of messages:

* Events
    ** Examples are: `NetworkEvent`, and `ProtocolEvent`. These are messages that can be dropped if they haven't been received, or added to the        channel buffer, before a timeout. Care should be taken to ensure that dropping one of these does not result in livelock.

* Commands
    ** Examples ares: `ProtocolCommand` and `NetworkCommand`. Those cannot be dropped.

## How is deadlock prevented?

When two components communicate with each other, one of these channels should be using `_Command` type of messages, and the other `_Event`. This ensures that if both channels are full, `_Event` messages will start being dropped, ensuring that the `_Command` messages are handled and the system does not deadlock.

## What risks are left?

First of all, dropping `_Event` messages could inadvertently result in the system not being able to make progress, a so-called livelock. 
Secondly, care should be taken not to introduce dependencies on `_Command` type of messages between components, even indirectly. For example, two components should not send each other `_Command`, not even indirectly via another, or multiple other, component(s).

## Blocking relationships

If a component has a relationship with another by sending `_Command` type of messages, than the receiving component cannot block on the sender, which means that it cannot send `_Command` type of messages to it, even indirectly via another, or several other, component(s).

* Storage cannot block on API and Consensus, blocks on nothing.
* Network cannot block on Protocol, Bootstrap, and Massa-node, blocks on Node(s).
* Protocol cannot block on Consensus and Pool, blocks on Network.
* Pool cannot block on Consensus and Massa-node, blocks on Protocol.
* Consensus cannot block on Bootstrap and Massa-node, blocks on Protocol, Pool, and Storage.
* API blocks on Storage and Massa-node.
* Massa-node cannot block on API, blocks on Consensus, Pool, and Network.
